In this module we’re gonna obtain basic knowledges about Polkadot ecosystem, and how Polkadot and Kusama networks operate.\n\nStarting with this very first lesson, we will dive into the history of Polkadot — ecosystem that promises to redefine the essence of blockchain technology.\n\n\n<Spoiler title=\"<h2 style='display: inline;' >Lesson 1. Exploring the Polkadot</h2>\">\n\n\n# **The Idea and Birth of Polkadot**\n\n## What is Polkadot\n\nPolkadot is an innovative project that aims to unlock the full potential of blockchain technology. It is not your average blockchain; it is a \"heterogeneous multichain\" that brings together multiple blockchains and other data structures into a single network. These interconnected blockchains, known as \"parachains,\" can interact with each other in a safe and scalable environment.\n\nOne of the fundamental approaches in the Polkadot ecosystem is the concept of shared security. This means that multiple blockchains in the Polkadot network are protected by a common group of validators. These validators, chosen through a nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus algorithm, secure the entire network by validating transactions and maintaining consensus. Their selection is based on their stake in the network's native cryptocurrency, DOT. Parachains can rely on the security measures provided by the Relay Chain according to this concept.\n\nPolkadot was created by Dr. Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, to solve the problem of blockchain interoperability - an issue that Ethereum and other blockchains struggle with.\n\n## From concept to a working project\n\n### Dr. Gavin Wood's Contributions and the Genesis of Polkadot\n\nDr. Gavin Wood is well-known for his contributions to the blockchain industry. He wrote the Ethereum Yellow Paper and designed the Solidity scripting language, which is used for writing smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). However, Wood believed that Ethereum was not capable of creating a truly decentralized ecosystem and left in 2015 to pursue his vision of creating a scalable, interoperable, and secure multi-chain framework for the next generation of the internet.\n\nThe idea for Polkadot arose from Wood's recognition of the limitations and challenges faced by Ethereum and other existing blockchains. While Ethereum attempted to address interoperability and scalability through smart contracts and dApps, Wood saw the solution in creating a framework that could facilitate interoperability among multiple blockchains while maintaining security. Thus, the concept of Polkadot was born.\n\nHere is a streamlined timeline of Polkadot's journey:\n\n- **2016:** Dr. Gavin Wood conceives the idea of Polkadot and establishes Parity Technologies to bring the concept to life.\n- **2017:** Wood publishes the Polkadot whitepaper titled \"Polkadot: Vision for a Heterogenous Multi-Chain Framework.\"\n- **2017-2019:** Polkadot undergoes development and testing phases.\n- **May 2020:** Official launch of the Polkadot Network.\n- **2020-Present:** Active growth and evolution.\n\n\n<robo-academy-note type=\"note\" title=\"Interesting fact\">\n\nWondering why a high-tech blockchain network is named «Polkadot»? The name is not random! It perfectly captures the essence of the project. Just like a polka dot pattern consists of unique dots, Polkadot consists of unique but interconnected parachains. Each \"dot\" represents a unique parachain serving its own purpose while being part of a larger network. The name Polkadot playfully acknowledges this diversity and interconnectedness.\n\n</robo-academy-note>\n\n# Why Polkadot has the potential?\n\nThe first ever cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, appeared in 2008 as a peer-to-peer (P2P) platform operating without a central bank or single administrator. Seven years later, Ethereum founders introduced self-executing smart contracts, which allowed the creation of d[Apps](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-decentralized-applications-dapps) and led to the [initial coin offering (ICO)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-an-ico) boom in 2017. Polkadot got even more advanced with the possibility of interconnecting different blockchains. What makes it so special compared to other gigantic blockchains?\n\nOne of the main reasons why [Bitcoin](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin) is not used everywhere is the amount of transactions per second (tps). Bitcoin averages about 5 tps, while [Ethereum](https://blockchair.com/ethereum) has around 15 tps, but still pretty low compared to Visa, which processes an average of 1700 tps and (doubtly) [can handle](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/BITCOIN-AND-ETHEREUM-VS-VISA-AND-PAYPAL-TRANSACTIONS-PER-SECOND_tbl2_330585021) up to 24,000 tps!\n\nOn the other hand, in Polkadot — a heterogeneous multichain — each parachains run in parallel, and processes its own transactions. This means that multiple transactions can be processed concurrently across various systems, significantly boosting the network’s capacity. The more parachains are added to the network, the greater the number of transactions that can be processed.\n\n# Kusama, Polkadot’s cousin\n\nKusama and Polkadot are two distinct yet interconnected networks. Often called the \"canary network,\" Kusama serves as an experimental counterpart to Polkadot. It was designed to allow developers to test and deploy blockchain innovations before implementing them on Polkadot.\n\nKusama shares the same basic architecture as Polkadot, including the relay chain, parachains, etc. However, it is an independent network created by the same team that built Polkadot. The key difference is that Kusama is a pre-production environment for real-world testing and an early-stage platform for emerging projects. It fosters inventive governance experiments and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Think of it as a fast-and-loose, less polished version of Polkadot.\n\nKusama has its own tradable token, **[KSM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kusama/)**, which is used for governance, such as voting on various proposals, staking, and bonding. \n\nIt's worth noting that this course was approved and sponsored through a proposal on Kusama.polkassembly. You can check out the referenda for yourself here: [click](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/150).\n\n# How can Polkadot and Kusama revolutionize web3?\n\nImagine you're using the internet today (the web2 world). You sign up for a social media platform, let's call it platform A. To do this, you create a username and password, provide your email, and so on. Platform A stores all that information on their centralized servers. Every time you upload a picture or post a comment, it all goes through platform A, so they essentially own your data. They can also shut down your account, and you won't have much to do about it.\n\nNow, let's move into the web3 world, powered by systems like Polkadot and Kusama. Here, you join a new social media platform, let's call it platform B. But this time, instead of creating a username and password, you use your digital wallet to create an account. This wallet is secured by blockchain technology and cryptography.\n\n<robo-academy-note type=\"note\">\n\nIn web3, the digital wallet isn't just a tool to keep your money on. It's your passport, your ID, and your bank, all in one. You can also use your wallet through different parachains, since they are a part of the Polkadot or Kusama relay chain. Wallet time!*\n\n</robo-academy-note> \n\nOn platform B, you're not just a user, you're a stakeholder. All your data is stored on a decentralized network and can't be wiped out by some company or government. In fact, all private data in web3 are non-fungible tokens. So, if you want to share your data with someone, you might even get paid for it. Sounds cool, right?\n\n# Extra\n\n## **Polkadot 2.0 Vision — Transitioning from Blockchain to Blockspace**\n\nThe Polkadot ecosystem is rapidly growing and developing. It can be difficult to stay informed about upcoming events, but the Polkadot Decoded 2023 conference in Copenhagen is definitely worth your attention. At the conference, Gavin Wood unveiled [Polkadot 2.0](https://polkadotters.medium.com/gavin-wood-unveils-the-next-era-of-polkadot-at-decoded-2023-transitioning-from-blockchain-to-4610774fd741), a transformative vision for the network. He was talking about a shift from traditional blockchain to what he calls \"blockspace\", even more scalable and powerful multi-chain ecosystem.\n\nWood introduced the concept of dynamic procurement of \"cores\" and a paradigm shift in Polkadot's architecture. The current lease model for cores is replaced with a system of selling \"core time,\" which offers developers increased flexibility through bulk and instantaneous sales. This approach aims to unlock innovation, increase capacity, and improve resource management within the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nThe introduction of \"bulk core time\" allows block space to be traded as a true commodity, reducing barriers to entry and fostering innovation. Polkadot 2.0 envisions DOT as more than just a token; it becomes a gateway for the influx of Web2 businesses into Web3.\n\nPlease keep in mind that these new features are still in the planning stages, aiming to address current issues. Nonetheless, it is quite interesting to know what will be happening to the network in the near future.\n\nP.S.: If you want to expand your knowledge of Polkadot even more, you can take a closer look at the Polkadot [whitepaper](https://polkadot.network/whitepaper/), or, atleast, a [lightpaper](https://polkadot.network/whitepaper/).\n\n</Spoiler>\n\n<Spoiler title=\"<h2 style='display: inline;' >Theory: Test</h2>\">\n\n<QuizBlock \nquizUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Quiz\"\nquizId=\"question1.1\"\n/>  \n\n<QuizBlock \nquizUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Quiz\"\nquizId=\"question1.2\"\n/>\n\n<QuizBlock \nquizUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Quiz\"\nquizId=\"question1.3\"\n/>\n\n</Spoiler>\n\n<FeedbackBlock \nformUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Feedback\"\nlessonLabel=\"intro-to-polkadot\"\n/>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/polkadot-and-kusama/overview.md","name":"overview"},"defaultName":"Polkadot and Kusama","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
