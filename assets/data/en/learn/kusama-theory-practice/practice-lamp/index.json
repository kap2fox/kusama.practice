First, you need to add your account address to the demo subscription list. You can do this using the [@robonomics_free_rws](https://t.me/robonomics_free_rws_bot)Telegram bot.\n2. Open the [dapp with demo](https://v0.dapp.robonomics.network/#/lights-up) and connect your account to it. In `Get IoT Subscription` line you should see that the subscription is active.\n3. Select the desired **color** you wish to illuminate the lamp with.\n4. Go through the **authentication** process in the Crust ecosystem. This authentication step serves the purpose of **storing information** of the chosen light settings for future reference. As this data is stowed away, an IPFS Hash is generated in the background.\n5. After signing and sending a transaction, a **launch extrinsic** will be dispatched. This extrinsic incorporates the IPFS hash and the robot account address. In about 15 seconds the lamp's color changes accordingly.\n\n<FeedbackBlock \nformUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Feedback\"\nlessonLabel=\"practice-lamp\"\n/>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/kusama-theory-practice/practice-lamp.md","name":"practice-lamp"},"defaultName":"Kusama â€” From Theory to Practice Course","lastUpdate":"2023-10-11T15:18:02.655Z"}},"context":{}}
