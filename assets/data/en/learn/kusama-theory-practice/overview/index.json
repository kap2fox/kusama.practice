Introduction</h2>\">\n\n\n# Welcome to the course!\n\nAre you curious about the revolutionary world of Web3 technologies? Look no further - you've come to the perfect starting point.\n\nIn collaboration with Robonomics Network, led by the visionary Professor Alexander Kapitonov, we proudly present this course dedicated to congition of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. Our mission is clear: to empower you with little to no prior knowledge of the Web3 world and offer a unique learning experience. In this course, we will discuss the technical and legal aspects of these networks, practice transactions, and cover the basics of application development. Alongside the relay chains, we will explore the following parachains: AssetHub, Basilisk, Karura, Moonriver, Crust, and Robonomics.\n\nThe authors of this course aim to provide you with a personal experience of working with Kusama. You can also replicate all the actions we perform in the lessons on your computer. The best way to complete this course is to follow all the actions in the browser simultaneously with the author, ensuring immediate results.\n\nThroughout the course, you will be asked to complete six tasks:\n\n1. Send your first transaction to the Rococo address.\n2. Create an on-chain proposal to the Rococo treasury.\n3. Create your own token in AssetHub.\n4. Obtain tokens for different parachains.\n5. Place an order for data storage in Crust Shadow.\n6. Control a lamp in the Robonomics parachain.\n\nYou have two options: you can complete all tasks in testnets to receive a certificate in Rococo, or you can continue with the second part of the course in Kusama to receive a certificate there. The second option grants you access to additional materials from the authors and invitations to upcoming events.\n\nToday marks the start of our journey into the Polkadot and Kusama networks, where the transformation from Web2 to a decentralized, transparent, and inclusive Web3 is already underway.\n\n</Spoiler>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/kusama-theory-practice/overview.md","name":"overview"},"defaultName":"Kusama — From Theory to Practice Course","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
