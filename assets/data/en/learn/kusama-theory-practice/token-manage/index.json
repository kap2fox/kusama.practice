Token distribution mechanisms\n\n# Introduction\n\nWe already know that tokens represent ownership, utility, or access rights within a specific blockchain project or platform. In Polkadot, tokens can be both fungible and non-fungible assets, and can be used in a wide range of applications, from dApps to fundraising and community engagement. Through its AssetHub, you can create your own ERC20 alike tokens (with limited functionality compared to standard ERC20 tokens) that are compatible with the Substrate-based blockchains and parachains inside the Polkadot ecosystem, and even non-fungible tokens (NFT’s) with NFT 2.0 functionalities.\n\nOnce the tokens are created, it’s time to share them with the community. In the video lesson you were taught to spread your testnet tokens for local needs, but you still have an option how big commercial projects sharing their tokens with the community, and the way an average user can earn money on it. So, the questions we’re asking are:\n\n- What is a token distribution?\n- What are the main ways to distribute tokens into the community?\n- How to earn money on token distribution?\n\nWe will answer them in this lesson!\n\n# Token distribution in a nutshell\n\n## What is a token distribution\n\nAt the heart of any stable-working blockchain are its users. They keep the network running and safe, increase the popularity of the network and price of tokens, and make important decisions that affect the networks future. That is why the success of a network is largely determined by how and to whom it’s native tokens are distributed.\n\nSince the dawn of the cryptocurrency era, the primary method of allocating tokens to users has been through the process of **mining**. For instance, the Bitcoin blockchain, with its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, initially rewarded miners with BTC for their efforts in validating and securing transactions through its Proof-of-Work algorithm. Over time, this reward has steadily diminished to regulate the coin issuance rate, rendering traditional mining less profitable in the present day. Subsequently, alternative consensus algorithms, such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), have emerged, incentivizing users to defend the network by rewarding them with the native token. However, the crypto landscape has witnessed the emergence of a multitude of tokens, in addition to traditional coins.\n\nLet’s refresh our memory about the main difference between coins and tokens: \n\n- Coins operate on their **own blockchain**;\n- Tokens operate on the basis of **another blockchain**.\n\nTokens are not distributed through mining, as coins are; they have their unique distribution mechanisms. We will discuss them below.\n\n## ICO\n\nThe **Initial Coin Offering** (ICO) is considered to be one of the earliest mass methods for distributing cryptocyrrency. It is  a new form of financing in which blockchain-related businesses raise public capital in exchange for new digital tokens. It can be compared to an IPO (Initial Public Offering), where companies sell their shares on a stock exchange to raise funds for business expansion and development. However, unlike IPOs, ICOs are less strictly regulated and are usually used by young startups. During an ICO, a project or platform offers a portion of newly issued cryptocurrency tokens to investors in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, or even fiat currencies.\n\nLet’s journey back to the very first ICO- performed by the **MasterCoin** in 2013 after it’s creator, J.R. Willett [popped up on the bitcointalk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=265488.0) explaining a supplementary protocol, improving Bitcoin blockchain with some additional features. He asked the community to contribute Bitcoin in exchange for MasterCoins, promising exclusive features for its holders. This ended up raising nearly $600.000!\n\n\n<robo-academy-note type=\"note\">\n MasterCoin was not only the first to perform ICO, but also the first utility token.\n</robo-academy-note>\n\n\nPolkadot Network was also the one that chose the ICO path. The initial supply of DOT tokens was 1 billion and it went through four rounds of funding — one private and three public. The first ICO took place in 2017 and raised $80 million. The last one was held in 2020 and generated $42,76 million.\n\nAs a result of these, investors received 58,4% of the initial token supply, the founders held 30%, and the rest, 11,6%, was allocated through rewards and airdrops.\n\n# AirDrops: Tokens from the Sky\n\nImagine waking up to discover money magically appearing in your wallet. While it may sound too good to be true, that’s a thing in crypto. Eventually, new crypto-projects spread their tokens in the community for free! That’s the allure of an **airdrop** - a quite common, simple and widespread method of token distribution that has been around for nearly a decade. Airdrops are like gifts to loyal community members, designed to spark interest and reward their loalty. \n\nMost of airdrops are divided into two types: **retroactive** and **bounty**. \n\n## **Retroactive airdrop**\n\nIf you’ve heard of someone unexpectedly receiving tokens for their past actions or interactions in some project, even though it wasn’t publicly announced - be sure that's a **retroactive airdrop, or retro-drop**. This kind of AD can be described as a surprise gift from the past, recognizing your contributions to this project.\n\nIn retro-drop tokens are distributed to users based on their historical interactions or contributions to a particular ecosystem. In other words, a retro-drop rewards investors, supporters, users, and adopters who went with the project from the inception.\n\nParticipating in a retroactive airdrop is a great way to earn high returns with minimal investments. Take Uniswap's retro-drop, for instance. They sent 300 USDC to users with previous transactions and later distributed 400 UNIs each to ~12,000 addresses that ever interacted with their smart contracts. You can learn more about this event **[here](https://airdrops.io/uniswap/)**.\n\n## **Bounty airdrop**\n\nBounty airdrops require participants to receive tokens in exchange for completing certain tasks or actions to support the goals of a project. These tasks typically promote and support project goals, such as raising awareness, engaging the community, or incentivising certain behaviours. They may be:\n\n- to share post on social media;\n- to join Telegram groups;\n- to refer friends to the project.\n\nCoin rewards serve to incentivize users to participate actively in project-related activities and contribute to project growth. One notable example is **Ontology**, which, in 2018, offered free ONT tokens to anyone who signed up for its newsletter to generate interest before the official token launch. Participants received 1000 ONT tokens, which were worth $2,800 when the token officially launched two months later.\n\n# Crowdloans: Token Distribution through Community Engagement\n\nAnother way of distributing tokens of new projects into the community is crowdloans. You’re already familiar with this term since it is a major part of the Polkadot ecosystem and has been enlightened a few times during our course. Crowdloans were first introduced by Polkadot itself to help new projects raise funds for securing a parachain slot on Polkadot or Kusama. \n\n**Here's how it works**: When a project applies for a parachain slot, an auction takes place, requiring DOT or KSM tokens to bid for a slot. These tokens are collected from the Polkadot community, and, in return, contributors receive a predetermined amount of the project's tokens.\n\nImagine you hold 1 KSM token and are looking for investment opportunities. You browse through the projects participating in the Kusama crowdloan and choose one. This project offers 10 of its tokens in exchange for 1 KSM token. You lock your KSM tokens for this project, and if it wins the auction, you receive those 10 tokens. If not, your KSM tokens are returned. Additionally, you regain your KSM tokens when the parachain slot duration for this project expires.\n\nThe winner of the first auction was Karura, a decentralized finance platform that raised over 500.000 KSM tokens (worth over $100 million at the time) from more than 14.000 contributors. For each KSM token they gave away minimum 12 KAR and overall distributed almost 7 million KAR.\n\n<Spoiler title=\"<h2 style='display: inline;' >Practice</h2>\">\n\n### Intro\n\nIn this practical task, you will use AssetHub on the Rococo testnet to mint your own token and then disperse them. The task will be considered successfully completed after you send your created tokens to the any 3 addresses.\n\n### Teleporting ROC\n\n1. Make sure you have enough ROC tokens (1 ROC is more then enough). If not, your can use [Triangle faucet](https://faucet.triangleplatform.com/polkadot/rococo) or any faucet that your can find in Internet. \n2. Select the Rococo testnet on the [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frococo-rpc.polkadot.io) portal. Go to the Accounts tab and choose Teleport.\n3. In `send from account` and `send to address` fields choose your account. In the destination chain field select **AssetHub**. Specify needed amount of ROC tokens and confirm the transaction.\n4. Go to AssetHub in Rococo and check that the tokens teleported successfully.\n\n### Creating assets\n\n1. Go to the Network tab and choose Assets→Overview. In the upper right corner, press `Create` button.\n2. Specify any `asset name`, `asset symbol`, `asset decimals`, `minimum balanc`, unique `asset id` and press `Next`.\n3. In `admin account`, `issuer account` and `freezer account` fields select your account. Press `Create` and confirm the transaction.\n4. Now you need to mint some amount tokens. In the Overview menu find your token in the list and press `Mint`.\n5. For your address specify any amount of tokens, press `Mint` and confirm the transaction.\n\n**Note**: In addition to sending your assets directly through the extrinsics, there is a convenient way to do this using the Polkadot.JS portal interface. Go to Assets→Balances menu and in the `asset to query for balances` field find your created token. Find your account with tokens and press `Send`. Prepare a transaction for sending and confirm it.\n\n### Dispersing tokens\n\nTo distribute your tokens to several addresses at once, we suggest you use [our Disperse script](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/163Fh9wre__w2srMuwyxTGSstK4xkPNiK?usp=sharing#scrollTo=EBtoEqYs7vYA), which we have posted on Google Collab. The script will run in the Collab environment, so you only need to fill in the appropriate fields.\n\n1. Run the first block of script to initialize the required packages for the Substrate interface.\n2. In the `SUBSTRATE_ENDPOINT` block, you need specify the data that will allow you to connect to the desired parachain. In our case, it is AssetHub Rococo, so you can leave the field blank.\n3. In the third block, you need to insert the seed phrase of the account from which your tokens will be sent.\n4. In the `ASSET_ID` block, enter the ID of your token.\n5. In the `WALLET_LIST` block, enter three addresses (in AssetHub Rococo format) separated by commas. These can be any three addresses, including any other accounts you have created.\n6. For an account to be considered existing by the network, it needs to have a certain minimum number of tokens (DOT in Polkadot, KSM in Kusama, XRT in Robonomics, etc). If the account is considered non-existent, you won't be able to send your created assets to it. To address this issue, a transaction has been added to the script for the initial sending of native tokens. For comparison, the table below shows the minimum deposit in different networks.\n    \n    \n    | Polkadot | Kusama | Rococo (and AssetHub) |\n    | --- | --- | --- |\n    | 1 DOT | 0.000333333333 KSM | 0.000033333333 ROC |\n    \n    To do this, in the `EXISTANCE_DEPOSIT` block, you need to specify the amount of native tokens (in this case ROC tokens, as we are in Rococo AssetHub) that will be equally distributed to the selected addresses. Keep in mind that you need to specify this amount in token fractions, depending on the number of zeros after the decimal point. In Rococo AssetHub, 1 ROC = 1 000 000 000 000.\n    \n7. In the `AMOUNT` field, you need to specify how much of your tokens will be equally distributed to the selected addresses. Keep in mind that you need to specify this amount in fractions of the token, depending on the number of decimal places you specified when creating your asset.\n8. Next, you need to sequentially execute two blocks that will send your transactions. The first transaction will send ROC tokens, and the second will send your asset tokens.\n\n</Spoiler>\n\n<FeedbackBlock \nformUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Feedback\"\nlessonLabel=\"token-manage\"\n/>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/kusama-theory-practice/token-manage.md","name":"token-manage"},"defaultName":"Kusama — From Theory to Practice Course","lastUpdate":"2023-09-11T20:46:24.477Z"}},"context":{}}
