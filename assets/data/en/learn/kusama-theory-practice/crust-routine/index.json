Decentralized Internet</h2>\">\n\n## Decentralized Internet\n\nThe decentralized web, often referred to as Web 3.0, is a vision of the internet that aims to shift away from the traditional, centralized model of the web towards a more distributed and peer-to-peer architecture. Unlike the current web, which relies heavily on centralized servers controlled by a few large corporations, the decentralized web seeks to empower users by giving them more control over their data, privacy, and online interactions.\n\nKey features of Decentalized Web include:\n\n**Decentralization:** In a decentralized web, data and services are distributed across a network of nodes, rather than being stored on centralized servers\n\n**Peer-to-Peer Networks:** Users' devices connect directly to each other, allowing them to share data and resources without relying on intermediaries.\n\n**Data Ownership and Privacy:** Decentralized web systems aim to give users greater control over their data. Instead of surrendering personal information to centralized platforms, users can store and control their data locally or within encrypted, distributed networks.\n\n**Censorship Resistance:** Because there is no central authority in the decentralized web, it's more difficult for governments or entities to censor or control content. Information can be stored and accessed without intermediaries imposing restrictions.\n\nIPFS in general and Crust as a supportive technologies make decenralized web much more real. \n\n### **DNS**\n\nIPFS implements it’s own **Domain Name System**, [IPNS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/), which is in opposite to centralized servers we usually ask for path to [google.com](http://google.com), works purely on decentralized network.\n\n### **Archive the web**\n\nAs a spread network with de-duplication properties, IPFS could store all the previous versions of web. It allows the **content of web be stored immutable**. Existing project could be found [here](https://github.com/oduwsdl/ipwb).\n\n### **Content delivery networks**\n\nA **Content Delivery Network** (CDN) is a network of nodes storing content in places physically close to the users. This guarantees low latency, load-balancing and worldwide scale for the content you want to distribute. The IPFS network is a **CDN by design** because each node will cache what they consume and serve that data to its peers\n\n### DApp (Decentralized Website)\n\nDapp hosting refers to **deploying** a Dapp front-end (sometimes also called Dapp interface) on a Web service that users can directly access, using a blockchain or smart contract as a back-end. Since the Dapp back-end is on the blockchain, users’ identities and assets are decentralized and secure.\n\nCrust-based decentralized Dapp Hosting distributes the Dapp interface to the entire Crust Network through **IPFS** in the form of **order transactions** on the Crust chain. When accessing the Dapp front-end, users can retrieve the Dapp interface from **nodes** of the entire Crust network, and non-performance of a given company or service cannot affect the **reliability and security** of the Dapp front-end.\n\n### Against the censorship\n\nWhen your websites and data is spread in peer-to-peer network, it’s almost impossible to block that data. One’s need to cut connections of all network from source.\n</Spoiler>\n\n<FeedbackBlock \nformUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Feedback\"\nlessonLabel=\"crust-routine\"\n/>\n","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/kusama-theory-practice/crust-routine.md","name":"crust-routine"},"defaultName":"Kusama — From Theory to Practice Course","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
