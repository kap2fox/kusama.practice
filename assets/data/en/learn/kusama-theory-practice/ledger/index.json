Ledger Wallet. A vault for your crypto\n\n## Introduction to Ledger Wallet\n\nWelcome to Lesson 5 of our journey! Today we will explore the advantages of using a **Ledger wallet**. As we’ve learned so far, crypto-wallets is a must in securely managing digital assets. A Ledger wallets takes security for your crypto to the whole next level reducing the chance of you losing your assets to virtually zero. Let’s find out how.\n\n## Why is Ledger safer for crypto?\n\n### **Difference between hot & cold wallets**\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, there are two types of wallets: software (hot) and hardware (cold) wallets. To understand what a Ledger wallet is, it's important to know the difference between them.\n\n**Software wallets** only require an application on your device to use, and they are disconnected from the internet. Examples of this type include **Talisman** for the Polkadot network, which we discussed in the previous lesson and is implemented as a browser extension, as well as other popular wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet.\n\n**Hardware wallets**, on the other hand, require an extra device in addition to the software. The **Ledger Wallet** belongs to this type. It is a physical device, often resembling a USB stick, specifically designed to store your private keys offline. This offline storage ensures that your private keys are not exposed to potential online threats, making hardware wallets like Ledger highly secure.\n\n<robo-academy-note type=\"note\">\nSome people may mistakenly think that their cryptocurrency is stored on their hardware wallet. However, this is not true. Only the private key that provides access to the wallet is stored on the hardware wallet. The cryptocurrency itself is stored on the blockchain.*\n</robo-academy-note>\n\nUsing a Ledger wallet is like having a personal vault for your digital assets. When you initiate a transaction, the hardware wallet signs it securely with the private key stored on the device. This signed transaction is then broadcasted to the network, ensuring that your private key never leaves the safety of the hardware wallet. As a result, even if your computer or mobile device is compromised by malware or hackers, your cryptocurrencies remain safe and inaccessible to unauthorized parties. But there’s one catch.\n\n### **Not a 100% safe**\n\nRemember, we mentioned that the Ledger wallet almost entirely eliminates the risk of losing your assets? While it is true that any cold wallet, including **Ledger**, is much safer than a software wallet due to the lack of internet connection, it still requires intermediary software provided by the developer to function. When selecting a cold wallet, this should be considered.\n\nIf you're wondering how to enhance the security of your crypto to 100%, there is one way - get rid of all custodians, including different wallet developers and crypto exchanges, and interact directly with the blockchain. This way, you keep the entire history of blockchain transactions on your device, which requires a significant amount of hard drive space. For example, the Bitcoin blockchain weighs approximately 500 GB, while Ethereum has already passed the 1 TB mark.\n\nPlease note that **Ledger wallet** recently [faced criticism](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/16/ledger-bats-back-criticism-of-new-wallet-recovery-service/) for its new \"Ledger Recover\" feature, where encrypted seed phrases are stored with third-party custodians. While Ledger's leadership has defended the offering as optional and secure, telling that users have the choice whether or not to participate in this service, some users in the crypto community have expressed concerns about privacy and security implications. As always, we encourage thorough research and due diligence before making decisions related to your crypto assets.\n\n## How to start using Ledger Wallet?\n\nTo begin securely storing your cryptocurrencies with Ledger, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Purchase** a Ledger hardware wallet directly from the **[official site](https://www.ledger.com/)** or authorized retailers. Ledger offers various models, such as Ledger Nano S, Nano X, Nano Xperience, each with different screen sizes, storage capacities, and connectivity options. Choose the one that best suits your needs.\n2. **Watch our video lesson on installation** and follow its steps. If you haven't watched it yet or need further assistance, continue with the next steps.\n3. **Unbox the device** and connect it to your computer or mobile via USB cable. Follow the instructions to set it up, including setting a secure PIN and writing down the recovery seed (mnemonic phrase) generated by Ledger.\n    \n    <robo-academy-note type=\"note\">Safeguard the recovery seed as it is crucial for wallet recovery in case of loss, theft, or damage. Keep it private and secure, like valuable information. Not a single person, including hardware wallet developer should know your key.*\n    </robo-academy-note> \n4. **Install the Ledger Live app** on your PC and authorize your device. Use Ledger Live to add the crypto-accounts you want to manage with your wallet, including popular cryptocurrencies like DOT and KSM from the Polkadot ecosystem.\n5. Now you can **receive** and **send** cryptocurrencies, participate in **staking**, and interact with DeFi apps using Ledger's user-friendly interface.\n\nRemember to treat your Ledger wallet like you would treat physical cash or valuable items, and always keep the device and recovery seed in a safe place to ensure the security of your digital assets.\n\n<Spoiler title=\"<h2 style='display: inline;' >Theory: Test</h2>\">\n\n<QuizBlock \nquizUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Quiz\"\nquizId=\"question5.1\"\n/>\n\n<QuizBlock \nquizUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Quiz\"\nquizId=\"question5.2\"\n/>\n\n<QuizBlock \nquizUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Quiz\"\nquizId=\"question5.3\"\n/>\n\n</Spoiler>\n\n<FeedbackBlock \nformUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Feedback\"\nlessonLabel=\"ledger\"\n/>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/kusama-theory-practice/ledger.md","name":"ledger"},"defaultName":"Kusama — From Theory to Practice Course","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
