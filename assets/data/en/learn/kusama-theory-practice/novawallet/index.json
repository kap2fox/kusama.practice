Polkadot in your hand</h2>\">\n\n# Introduction\n\nIn the previous lessons, we explored two suitable wallets for the Polkadot ecosystem, both intended for use on your PC. But what if you need a wallet on your phone to manage your assets on the go? That's where **Nova Wallet** fits perfectly. But it also can do a few more things. Let's explore this next-gen wallet for the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.\n\n# Enhancing interaction with Polkadot governance system\n\n## OpenGov concept\n\nIn the second lesson of our course, we briefly introduced you to Polkadot's new community-driven governance model with no central authority - OpenGov. Let's dive further in this concept:\n\nJuly 2020**.** Polkadot launched the first governance model called **Governance V1**, which at the time was already the most advanced and decentralized democracy system. It included three main components:\n\n1. **The Technical Committee** - a technocratic committee to manage upgrade timelines.\n2. **The Council** - an approval-voted, elected executive \"government\", representing the passive stakeholders of Polkadot and/or Kusama, to manage parameters, admin, spending proposals and vetoing dangerous or malicious referenda.\n3. **The Public** - all token holders.\n\nOver the first few years of operation, Governance V1 ensured the appropriate usage of treasury funds and enabled timely upgrades and fixes. However, like most early technologies, protocols must evolve as they mature to improve their shortcomings and keep up with modern advancements. \n\nImportant to know, in Governance V1, all referenda carried the same weight as only one referendum could be voted on at a time (except for emergency proposals), and the voting period could last multiple weeks. Also, an alternating voting timetable allowed voters to vote either for a public referendum or a council motion every 28 days. This resulted in the system favoring careful consideration of very few proposals instead of broad consideration of many.\n\nIn July 2022, the OpenGov (or Governance V2) was launched as the new governance system that replaced Governance V1. It has become even more decentralized, open, efficient, and future-facing than the previous one. Here's why:\n\n- **The Technical Committee and the Council were removed**. All decision-making power came to the community through a referenda system. Instead, the decentralized Polkadot Fellowship became the new technical expertise, which, in fact, does not have hard power over the network;\n- **A multirole delegation system appeared**. If you do not count yourself as the bright mind of the crypto world, you can follow some network member and share your vote with him. One for staking, one for treasury, another for technical moments. You got the idea;\n- **Multiple parallel referenda tracks**. The community can vote on thousands of proposals at any time.\n\nOpenGov changed how the practical means of day-to-day decisions are made, making the repercussions of referenda better scoped and agile to increase the number of collective decisions the system can make at any given time. Polkadot switched its governance system to bring the next generation of decentralized, secure, and democratic governance to ecosystem.\n\n## Polkassembly\n\nThe main platform for implementing OpenGov in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems is the **[Polkassembly](https://polkassembly.io/)**, supported by Web3 foundation and Polkadot & Kusama treasury. Polkassembly provides a place for ecosystem users to participate in Polkadot governance by proposing and voting on public referenda. It offers information on current referenda, latest proposals, motions, treasury proposals, tips, bounties, and more.\n\nPolkadot OpenGov transferred all responsibilities of the Council to the public through a direct democracy voting system. Users can browse proposals made on-chain, discuss them with the community, and vote directly from the platform. Polkassembly implements governance in all Substrate-compatible networks, including:\n\n- **Polkadot & Parachains;**\n- **Kusama & Parachains;**\n- **Solo Chains;**\n- **Test Chains.**\n\n<robo-academy-note type=\"note\">\nAs for the august 23 OpenGov is available on a few networks: Polkadot, Kusama, Moonbeam. The rest are pulling up soon.\n</robo-academy-note> \n\n\nTo participate in referenda on a specific network, simply select that network on the main platform page via a pop-up menu or its address, such as [polkadot.polkassembly.io](http://polkadot.polkassembly.io/) or [kusama.polkassembly.io](http://kusama.polkassembly.io/).\n\nEach network has its own fund, presented on Polkassembly, which receives cryptocurrency collected through a portion of block production rewards, transaction fees, slashing, staking inefficiencies, and more. These funds are distributed through treasury proposals, which are subject to governance. The current default spend period is 24 days. If the Treasury ends a spend period without fully using its funds, it will suffer a burn of a portion of its funds.\n\n## Governance through Nova Browser\n\nNova Wallet makes easier than ever before to observe, participate, and delegate in Polkadot OpenGov through mobile device. \n\nNova has his own built-in browser which provides quick access to various web pages while connecting your Nova Wallet accounts to interact with Polkassembly. The catalogue is also contains different decentralized applications within the Polkadot ecosystem, such NFT, Staking, Bridges, Crowdloans, **decentralized exchange (DEX)**, Utilities (like Polkadot.js) and more. Through this browser you can participate in Polkadot governance on Polkassembly, with your Nova account connected to it. Sounds very user-friendly!\n\n### InApp governance\n\nNova also provides users the ability to participate in governance processes, such as voting on referenda, extremely simple directly in the App. In the Vote section, you can check all ongoing referenda and yay/nay it with your tokens. You even have the option to delegate your voting power to another account, voting alongside it!\n\nYou can use Nova Wallet to easily contribute to Polkadot and Kusama crowdloans in a non-custodial way, which one we strongly recommend you to do it, and not via a **Centralized Exchange (CEX)**.\n\n# **Staking in Nova**\n\nNova Wallet provides two main ways to stake DOT or KSM tokens: self-delegation or via a **[Nomination Pool](https://novawalletapp.medium.com/polkadot-staking-nomination-pools-are-live-7b3284232c66)**.\n\n\"What is the difference?\" you may ask. Well, in self-delegation, you personally control which Validator nodes your tokens are staked with, while nomination pools allow users to pool their funds together and nominate/stake as a group, greatly reducing the amount of tokens required to begin staking.\n\nIn addition to DOT and KSM tokens, you can also stake tokens from various parachains, such as **AZERO, KMA, GLMR, MOVR, PDEX, CAPS, TUR, WND, and ZTG**, with attractive APYs ranging from 8.64% to 81%.\n\n# Setting up Nova Wallet\n\nNova Wallet is available for download on both the App Store and Google Play Store. After downloading the app, you can choose to create a new wallet within Nova or import an existing one using your recovery seed or private key. The good news is that Nova is compatible with all major wallets, including Talisman for your browser, Ledger for secure crypto storage, as well as Polkadot.js account, and popular wallets like MetaMask – all in one hand. Sounds convenient, doesn't it? By the way, there’s a detailed overview of the installation in our video lesson, we hope you watched it.\n\n---\n\n# Module conclusion\n\nSummarising this part of our course, we have learned about convenient solutions for managing crypto-assets in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. These wallets go beyond storage and offer various functionalities that allow users to engage with the evolving landscape of Web3. Summarising the key takeaways from this module's lessons, we explored the benefits of using Talisman, Ledger, and Nova wallets:\n\n**Lesson 4 - Talisman.** Talisman is a crypto-wallet with its own platform and browser extension, that acts as a versatile gateway to over 150 Substrate and EVM networks via cross-chain interoperability. It facilitates the process of managing assets from various sources through a unified user-friendly interface by connecting different networks as a bridge. Talisman serves as a genuine Web3 companion, enabling participation in management and decision-making within the Polkadot and Kusama networks.\n\n**Lesson 5 - Ledger.** This lesson explains the contrast between software (hot) and hardware (cold) wallets – robust safeguards for secure cryptocurrency storage. One such hardware wallet is Ledger - physical storage resembling a flash driver, which provides substantial protection by storing private keys offline - shielding digital assets from online threats and hacking attempts, thus ensuring a high degree of safety. Nevertheless, even though Ledger and other hardware wallets reduce risks significantly, they do not guarantee a 100% protection of your assets.\n\n**Lesson 6 - Nova.** We explored Nova Wallet, a mobile solution for managing assets within the Polkadot network. Nova's toolkit offers various functionalities that exceed simple transactions, such as staking, governance, and crowdloans. Nova Wallet empowers users to engage actively in network procedures, exert voting power, and contribute crowdloans in a non-custodial way. The integrated browser enables access to Polkadot dApps, and notably the OpenGov system on Polkassembly, resulting in a user-friendly mobile interaction. Overall, Nova proves to be an excellent web3 unified hub as it is compatible with various wallet types.\n\n## Next module\n\nThe upcoming module of our course will focus on managing assets via AssetHub, a distinct parachain within the Polkadot ecosystem. AssetHub allows you to design your own token, which you can then implement for various purposes, such as website authorization. Furthermore, we will elaborate on the advantages of the Internet's shift to the Web3 phase, with an emphasis on Polkadot's contribution to this evolution.\n\n---\n\n# Extra\n\n[A Walkthrough of Polkadot’s Governance](https://www.polkadot.network/blog/a-walkthrough-of-polkadots-governance)\n\n</Spoiler>\n\n\n<Spoiler title=\"<h2 style='display: inline;' >Theory: Test</h2>\">\n\n<QuizBlock \nquizUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Quiz\"\nquizId=\"question6.1\"\n/>\n\n<QuizBlock \nquizUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Quiz\"\nquizId=\"question6.2\"\n/>\n\n<QuizBlock \nquizUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Quiz\"\nquizId=\"question6.3\"\n/>\n\n\n</Spoiler>\n\n\n<FeedbackBlock \nformUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Feedback\"\nlessonLabel=\"novawallet\"\n/>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/kusama-theory-practice/novawallet.md","name":"novawallet"},"defaultName":"Kusama — From Theory to Practice Course","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
