Nova Wallet. All you need in one hand\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the previous lessons, we explored two suitable wallets for the Polkadot ecosystem, both intended for use on your PC. But what if you need a wallet on your phone to manage your assets on the go? That's where Nova Wallet fits perfectly. Let's explore this next-gen wallet for the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.\n\n## Features and functionality\n\nNo need to remind you that web3 world is not only about sending and receiving crypto. As well as the previous two wallets, Nova provides a comprehensive toolkit on your phone that allows you to explore and participate in over 63 networks, offering a wide range of functions, including:\n\n1. **Staking**\n\nNova Wallet provides two main ways to stake **DOT** or **KSM** tokens: self-delegation or via a **[Nomination Pool](https://novawalletapp.medium.com/polkadot-staking-nomination-pools-are-live-7b3284232c66)**.\n\n\"What is the difference?\" you may ask. Well, in self-delegation, you personally control which Validator nodes your tokens are staked with, while nomination pools allow users to pool their funds together and nominate/stake as a group, greatly reducing the amount of tokens required to begin staking.\n\nIn addition to **DOT** and **KSM** tokens, you can also stake tokens from various parachains, such as **AZERO, KMA, GLMR, MOVR, PDEX, CAPS, TUR, WND, and ZTG**, with attractive APYs ranging from 8.64% to 81%.\n\n\n<robo-academy-grid :columns=\"2\" textAlign=\"center\">\n    <robo-academy-grid-element>\n        <LessonImages src=\"kusama-theory-practice/lesson6-staking-list.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n    </robo-academy-grid-element>\n    <robo-academy-grid-element>\n        <LessonImages src=\"kusama-theory-practice/lesson6-stake-dot.png\" alt=\"\"/>\\\n    </robo-academy-grid-element>\n</robo-academy-grid>\n\n\n1. **Governance & Crowdloans**\n\nNova Wallet makes participating in governance processes, such as voting on referenda, extremely simple. In the Vote section, you can check all ongoing referenda and yay/nay it with your tokens. You even have the option to delegate your voting power to another account, voting alongside it!\n\nYou can use Nova Wallet to easily contribute to Polkadot and Kusama crowdloans in a non-custodial way, which one we strongly recommend you to do it, and not via a Centralized Exchange (CEX).\n\n\n<robo-academy-grid :columns=\"2\" textAlign=\"center\">\n    <robo-academy-grid-element>\n        <LessonImages src=\"kusama-theory-practice/lesson6-vote-governance.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n    </robo-academy-grid-element>\n    <robo-academy-grid-element>\n        <LessonImages src=\"kusama-theory-practice/lesson6-vote-crowdloans.png\" alt=\"\"/>\n    </robo-academy-grid-element>\n</robo-academy-grid>\n\n\n1. **Nova Browser with quick acces to Polkadot dApps**\n\nNova's built-in browser provides quick access to various web pages while connecting your Nova Wallet accounts to interact with Polkadot and EVM dApps. The catalogue contains different dApps within the Polkadot ecosystem, such as DEX, Governance, NFT, Staking, Crowdloans, and more.\n\n## Setting up Nova Wallet\n\nNova Wallet is available for download on both the App Store and Google Play Store. After downloading the app, you can choose to create a new wallet within Nova or import an existing one using your recovery seed or private key. The good news is that Nova is compatible with all major wallets, including Talisman for your browser, Ledger for secure crypto storage, as well as Polkadot.js account, and popular wallets like MetaMask – all in one hand. Sounds convenient, doesn't it? By the way, there’s a detailed overview of the installation in our video lesson, we hope you watched it.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNova Wallet stands out as one of the most user-friendly and effective crypto wallets for mobile phones. Its full compatibility with the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems makes it an ideal choice for Web3 tasks, offering versatility and convenience. However, it's essential to remember that a wallet like Nova is simply an interface for accessing your assets, which are always securely stored in the blockchain (especially in the case of non-custodial wallets like Nova). The responsibility for wallet security lies directly with the user and how diligently they handle their seed phrase. We conclude the block dedicated to cryptocurrency wallets and switching to the exploration of Asset Hub - a powerful tool for creating, managing, and customizing your own tokens.
