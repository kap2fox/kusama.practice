Legal ways to obtain KSM</h2>\">\n\n# Introduction\n\n## Recap of the third module\n\nLet's quickly review what we learned in the previous module.\n\nIn Module 3 of this course, we explored the possibilities of AssetHub, a system parachain in the Polkadot network, also available in the Kusama & Polakadot networks and testnets Rococo & Westend. The main purpose of AssetHub is to mint and manage user assets, specifically fungible and non-fungible tokens. These tokens can be used for various purposes: from simple buying and selling to a wide range of use as a Web3 feature.\n\nFurthermore, we examined a specific example of using a token created in AssetHub to authorize a website. That was the showcase of how you can already take advantage of the upcoming next phase of the Internet.\n\n## Introduction to KSM\n\nThis module focuses on taking a closer look at the non-system parachains within the Kusama ecosystem and the projects behind them. We will explore notable projects such as Karura, Basilisk, and Moonriver that serves as DEX platforms for teleporting tokens through cross-chain communication in Kusama network. But before we dive into those parachains, we are going to discuss the ways to get you KSM tokens at first.\n\n# Cryptocurrency legal field\n\nWhen it comes to purchasing crypto assets with high market capitalization and trading volumes, it is important to note that cryptocurrency regulations and tax treatment vary from country to country. Tax-free jurisdictions include Germany, Belarus, El Salvador, Portugal, Singapore, Malaysia, Malta, Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico, Switzerland, and Georgia. So, unless you’re living in one of these countries, it is essential to familiarize yourself with the local laws regarding taxation in your region.\n\n<robo-academy-note type=\"note\">\nDid you know that major crypto projects, blockchains, and exchanges are based in the aforementioned countries to avoid additional taxes? For instance, Polkadot, and its main supporter - Web3 Foundation are incorporated in Switzerland. And Binance, the largest centralized exchange, is based in the Cayman Islands.\n</robo-academy-note>\n\n\nNow, for instance, let's examine the situation of cryptocurrency taxation in the United States, which is one of the largest and important crypto markets.\n\n### **Crypto taxation in the USA**\n\nCrypto projects involved in issuing, trading, or facilitating transactions of securities or regulated assets are subject to the jurisdiction and enforcement actions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC may apply existing securities laws and regulations to blockchains or create new rules and guidance specific to crypto assets in order to protect an American investors.\n\nThe tax status of a token depends a lot on whether it is classified as a utility or a security.\n\n1. If the SEC classifies a token as a security, it may impact the user's taxation, especially if they receive income from such a token. Taxes may be imposed on gains from selling securities and on income associated with them. Users may be responsible for capital gains and other taxes.\n2. If the token is classified as a utility and is only used within the project ecosystem to access services or goods, users may have fewer tax liabilities when using them, as it is similar to exchanging goods or services.\n\nTo determine whether a token is a security, the SEC applies the Howey test. This test states that a token qualifies as a security if it involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit from the efforts of others. Even utility tokens may be considered securities if they are sold as part of an initial coin offering (ICO) or generate passive income for holders.\n\nHowever, the SEC's approach to regulating cryptocurrencies is not always clear or consistent and may change over time. This creates legal uncertainty and regulatory risk for blockchains and their users. It can be challenging for individuals to determine if their activities comply with SEC rules and they may face penalties or sanctions for violations. Many cryptocurrencies operate in a regulatory \"grey area\" where existing laws and regulations do not clearly define their legality. Questions like:\n\n- whether cryptocurrency is a security?\n- how ICOs should be regulated?\n- how crypto transactions should be taxed?\n\nare examples of issues that fall into these grey areas.\n\nThe United States has the strictest laws regarding unregistered securities offerings. Several prominent cryptocurrency entities, including Ripple, FTX, and Celsius, have faced scrutiny due to the unclear status of their cryptocurrencies.\n\n### **DOT and KSM status**\n\n<robo-academy-note type=\"note\">\nWe consider the KSM token equivalent to DOT in a legal sense. This means that all interactions between Polkadot and DOT with the SEC can also be applied to Kusama and KSM.\n</robo-academy-note>\n\n\nFor over 3 years, W3F has been in discussions with the SEC to determine the regulatory status of Polkadot's native token. These engagements, led by the SEC's Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub), aimed to provide guidance on how DOT could avoid being classified as a security.\n\nThe discussions with the SEC focused on two main aspects regarding Polkadot: ensuring that the technology was fully developed to demonstrate that DOT had real utility, and examining how the Web3 Foundation was relinquishing control over the network's day-to-day operations.\n\n*\"Over the years, we have developed what we believe is a workable theory of how token morphing may be achieved for an increasingly decentralized project, like Polkadot, and a digital asset that, other than having been offered and sold initially for fundraising purposes, does not, itself, bear security-like characteristics.\" - W3F.*\n\nAfter all those negotiations with the SEC, in November 2022, W3F [announced](https://medium.com/web3foundation/less-trust-more-truth-polkadots-native-token-dot-has-morphed-and-is-not-a-security-b2a8847a70cc) that the digital asset DOT, which was initially offered and sold as a security, has now morphed into a software.\n\nWhat does this mean? \n\nAccording to W3F, DOT is being used for its intended purposes, such as bidding for and securing parachains, as well as facilitating on-chain governance. It is, in fact, a tool for controlling the Polkadot network, held by DOT holders. \n\nThe same applies to KSM.\n\n# Where to get KSM tokens?\n\nThere are two ways to get and store cryptocurrency, especially KSM: through **custodial** centralized exchanges or on a decentralized one using a **non-custodial** wallet. The choice of wallet type to store your tokens is yours to make. Let's explain the difference in simple terms:\n\n1. Custodial wallets refer to intermediaries that act as third parties in your transactions. These are typically centralized exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, KuCoin, Coinbase Exchange, and others. These exchanges provide built-in wallets where you can store your crypto. With custodial wallets, you need to trust the custodian completely because they have access to your assets. However, a benefit is that if you lose the private key to your wallet, the exchange can assist you in recovering it, saving you money.\n\nSo, which centralized exchanges can you get KSM on?\n\nYou can find the full list of markets where you can exchange KSM at [coingecko.com](http://coingecko.com/) or [coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com/). On the second website, you can sort CEX and DEX markets separately.\n\nWe recommend using the Chinese marketplace [Huobi](https://www.huobi.com/ru-ru/) (HTX) to exchange KSM for USDT stablecoin. You can pre-purchase USDT for fiat currency at [bestchange.com](http://bestchange.com/). We have provided a video that shows the process of transferring KSM to your Talisman wallet.\n\n2. The second method involves getting crypto on a decentralized exchange, which requires a non-custodial wallet connected to the platform, such as MetaMask. However, it is not compatible with DOT and KSM, so it is not suitable for us. Talisman, Nova, and Polkadot.js wallets, which we have discussed in our tutorials, are recommended. When using such wallets, you are fully responsible for the safety of your funds, and the exchanges themselves do not store any of your data. There is also a risk - if you lose the key to your wallet, no one will restore it.\n\nTo get KSM via decentralized exchanges, refer to the list of DEX on [coinmarketcap.com](http://coinmarketcap.com/) as mentioned earlier. Our recommend is to use the most suitable one - Karura, the DeFi hub of Kusama. We will explain how it works in our next lesson.
