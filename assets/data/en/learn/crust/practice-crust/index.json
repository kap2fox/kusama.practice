The task\nis presented in two options: sending a file to the Crust Rocky test network and to the Crust Shadow network on Kusama.\nThe difference is that for Crust Rocky, you can get free test tokens, while Crust Shadow will require you to have CSM\ntokens in your balance.\n\n### Using Crust Rocky\n\n1. First you need to get test CRU tokens. Go to Crust Discord[#ðŸš°faucet channel](https://discord.gg/d6XuBXCqxU) and send\n   your account address on Crust Rocky. After few seconds, you will get tokens.\n2. Open the Crust Rocky network on\n   the [app portal](https://apps.crust.network/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc-rocky.crust.network#/storage).\n3. Go to the **Storage** tab and choose Storage user. You will see the interface for storage orders.\n4. Press `Place order` button. You will see order parameters.\n5. Paste the CID from the previous lesson (TXT file with your address) to the `File CID` field.\n6. For the `File size` field you need to calculate the size of file in bytes. You can check it in IPFS Client or\n   calculate it in any other way convenient for you.\n7. You can add tips for more reliable storage of your file.\n8. Submit the transaction and sign it.\n\n### Using Crust Shadow\n\n1. Open the Crust Shadow network on\n   the [Polkadot.js portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%253A%252F%252Frpc-shadow.crust.network%252F#/).\n2. Go to the **Developer** tab and choose **Extrinsics**â†’**Submission**.\n3. For your account, choose `xstorage->placeStorageOrder` in the `submit the following extrinsic` field.\n4. Paste the CID from the previous lesson (TXT file with your address) to the `cid` field.\n5. For the `size` field you need to calculate the size of file in bytes. You can check it in IPFS Client or calculate it\n   in any other way convenient for you.\n\n   **Warning**: The file size determines how many tokens will be spent on its pin. If you specified a smaller size, then\n   the file will probably not be pinned. And if you specified a larger size, you will spend extra tokens.\n\n6. Leave the `currencyId` field with `SelfReserve` option.\n7. Submit the transaction and sign it. The task will be considered complete once a successful transaction appears on the\n   Crust Shadow network at [Subscan](https://shadow.subscan.io/).\n\n<AccountManager>\n   <PracticeChecker\n              practiceCheckerUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/checker/check_task\"\n              taskId=\"crust_rocky_order\"\n              question=\"Enter ipfs cid(Qm...) of pinned .txt file\"\n          ></PracticeChecker>\n    <PracticeChecker\n              practiceCheckerUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/checker/check_task\"\n              taskId=\"crust_shadow_order\"\n              question=\"Enter ipfs cid(Qm...) of pinned .txt file\"\n          ></PracticeChecker>\n</AccountManager>\n\n<FeedbackBlock\nformUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Feedback\"\nlessonLabel=\"practice-crust\"\n/>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/crust/practice-crust.md","name":"practice-crust"},"defaultName":"Crust","lastUpdate":null}},"context":{}}
