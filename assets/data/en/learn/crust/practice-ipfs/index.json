The task will be considered successfully completed after sending to us of fileâ€™s CID and verifying the availability on [IPFS Scan](https://ipfs-scan.io/).\n\n### Task\n\n1. To begin, you'll need to install an IPFS client on your computer or server. IPFS provides easy-to-use [command-line tools](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/) and [graphical interfaces](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/), depending on your preference. \n2. Start an IPFS node, which will join the global IPFS network. Wait for the IPFS client to connect and find other peers.\n3. Prepare the file for upload: create a TXT file and write your previously created address on the Kusama network in one line.\n4. Import this file into your IPFS client. Wait for the moment when the file is downloaded and copy its CID.\n5. Make sure the file is accessible using the [IPFS Scan](https://ipfs-scan.io/) service. To check, use the CID of the file.\n\n<AccountManager>\n    <PracticeChecker\n              practiceCheckerUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/checker/check_task\"\n              taskId=\"ipfs_pin\"\n              question=\"Enter ipfs cid(Qm...) of pinned .txt file\"\n          ></PracticeChecker>\n</AccountManager>\n\n<FeedbackBlock \nformUrl=\"https://faas-fra1-afec6ce7.doserverless.co/api/v1/web/fn-18e93402-1ffe-47e8-be1d-e28a6ac871f1/default/Feedback\"\nlessonLabel=\"practice-ipfs\"\n/>","fileInfo":{"path":"en/learn/crust/practice-ipfs.md","name":"practice-ipfs"},"defaultName":"Crust","lastUpdate":"2023-10-13T13:04:43.278Z"}},"context":{}}
