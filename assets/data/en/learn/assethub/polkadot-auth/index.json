Web3 Transition</h2>\">\n\n# Introduction\n\nHow do you envision the near future of the Internet? Will it remain the current Web2 landscape, dominated by large tech giants and centralized platforms? Or will it undergo a profound transformation leading to a more user-centric and secure digital biome? The key to the answer may very well reside in the internet’s ongoing transition from Web2 to Web3, unfolding before our very eyes.\nPolkadot ecosystem is a major part of this transition, paving the path for the future of the internet by promoting user-driven governance, blockchain interoperability, cryptocurrency adoption, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized applications (dApps), and more - reshaping the current internet landscape. Let’s discover how the internet today is replacing its basic mechanisms with Web3 features.\n\n# WWW: From Web1.0 to Web3.0\n\n## A digital history of the Internet\n\n**The Internet** — a global network that connects billions of people around the world, is such a powerful system that it can be used for almost any purpose that depends on information, and its largest collection of information - the **World Wide Web (WWW)** - is a collection of billions of interconnected digital documents that are accessible to everyone through web browsers such as Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox and others. The WWW has changed a lot since its first version, and today it is undergoing a massive evolution. We can imagine it as a story with three chapters.\n\n**Chapter one: Read - only Web 1.0**\n\nThe story of the Internet as the World Wide Web begins in 1989 with its first version - **Web1**, often referred to as the \"static web\" or the \"read-only web\". It was a simple time when the Internet was a one-way street where information flowed from the few to the many. The Web1 was like a library where you could read, but you couldn't write or interact. It was the age of static web pages and basic HTML, and the idea of a dynamic and interactive Internet was still a dream.\n\n**Chapter two: Read - Write Web 2.0**\n\nAs time passed, in 2004, the pioneers of the digital world began to create a new narrative. **Web2** or the \"Dynamic Web\" or the \"Read-Write Web\" was born. In this version, the Internet became a two-way street. Now you could not only read, but also write, create and interact. The emergence of social media, e-commerce and user-generated content platforms transformed the internet into a vast marketplace of ideas and experiences. By 2022, the number of internet users will have reached 5 billion people, with 4.7 billion of them having social network accounts.\n\nUsers of the Web2 era faced some serious challenges. Centralization, privacy concerns and control by the few became the dark clouds of this oasis. At this point, the Internet is mostly made up of a few large platforms, social networks, forums that collect and store their users' data, censor content, and make large amounts of money from personalised advertising. This has led to a significant number of data leaks, copyright infringements, etc. In response to this oligopoly, people began to yearn for an Internet where they had more control over their online lives.\n\n**Chapter three: Read - Write - Own Web3.0**\n\nAfter the emergence of Ethereum in 2013, Gavin Wood resurrected old thoughts about **Web3** - the \"decentralized web\" or \"user-centred web\" or \"read-write-own web\" - the final chapter in our story that is still being written. Web3 is being touted as the future of the internet, based on the principles of decentralization and blockchain technologies. It seems to be a place where trust and data security are built into the very fabric of the internet, and where governance is distributed among the many, not the few.\n\nThe basic principles of Web3.0 can be summarised as:\n\n- **Decentralization.** The WWW is based on distributed ledger technology, not servers. And ownership of all content on the Internet is held by users, not corporations;\n- **Public availability**. Everyone has equal access to Web3, no one can be excluded, banned or restricted from the ecosystem;\n- **Native payments.** Using decentralized protocols instead of banks and payment systems that rely on outdated infrastructure;\n- **No need to trust a third party**. Through the use of various economic incentives and other mechanisms.\n\n<robo-academy-note type=\"note\">\n“Web 3.0 is the next phase of the Internet, where intelligence will be built into everything and the web will become truly semantic.” ~**Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web**\n</robo-academy-note>\n\nWeb3 is seen as the answer to the monopoly that centralised corporations have had over the Internet since the advent of Web2. It is built, operated and owned by its users.\n\n## Web3 vision based on blockchain technologies\n\nThere is not yet a clear concept of Web3, but there is a vision. People see it as decentralized, user-centric, and blockchain-powered web, aiming to shift control from centralized entities to users, foster interoperability between different blockchain networks, and establish trust to this system through cryptographic mechanisms and smart contracts. \n\nThe implementation of blockchains - a type of distributed ledger database, protected by cryptography and stored away from data servers - was the major step in the transition from Web2 to Web3. Blockchain technology itself, and those that are built on top of it, was literally created to build a Web3 future:\n\n**NFT**. Blockchains, allows its users to create and exchange digital tokens that represent value or ownership, making it possible to own and make money from all your digital data, such as pictures, videos, drawings, texts, in-game treasures and many others. Anything you create on the web could be turned into an NFT and sold. \n\n**Smart contracts**. Then, the smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements that can automate processes and enforce rules in Web3, have also been enabled based on blockchain technology.\n\n**DAO**. A new type of digital company governed by code and operating on blockchain networks, bringing true democracy to the internet, concentrating power and decision-making not in the hands of corporations as it is now, but in the hands of users with voting rights, usually tokens - is perfectly suited to user-centred Internet governance.\n\n**DApps**. Applications that run on blockchain networks could be a perfect alternative to centralised social networks and other platforms that collect and store user data, due to blockchain's ability to record transactions in a secure, transparent and immutable way. All data is protected by consensus mechanisms, smart contracts and decentralised storage.\n\nImagine if one of the big digital companies, for example Instagram, was a dApp. Then Instagram users would not send their data to the servers owned by the network owners, because the whole network would be distributed among the nodes, and no one could be banned or excluded from the network by the will of a few.\n\n# Projects driving Web3\n\n- **Polkadot**\n\nPolkadot is the project that comes closest to the concept of Web3. It is the flagship protocol of the **Web3 Foundation**, an organization founded by Dr. Gavin Wood that supports and funds the development of decentralized Web3.\n\nThe main challenge facing the spread of blockchain technology is scalability. Current blockchains can be compared to computers before the internet: separate ecosystems with no way of communicating with each other. Polkadot solves this problem by connecting existing blockchains in a network and enabling the creation of new ones. In this way, Polkadot can be likened to a network of computers communicating with each other over the internet, making it a great foundation on which to build Web3.\n\nThe transition to Web3 is happening right now. In the video above, we demonstrated how Web3 features can replace basic Web2 functionality by enabling website authorisation with tokens created in the Polkadot AssetHub. If you're a website developer, this could be a useful tool for you, especially with the source code we've prepared on GitHub (link in the extra section).\n\n<robo-academy-note type=\"note\">\nIt's important to remember that any feature in Web3 should be open source and for the good of the people!.\n</robo-academy-note>\n\n\nBesides Polkadot, there are many other projects developing and promoting the future of Web3. These include:\n\n- **Ethereum**\n\nEthereum is known as the pioneer of smart contracts and decentralised applications (dApps). It's ecosystem hosts various dApps, DeFi protocols, NFT, marketplaces and more.\n\nWe've talked before about dApps replacing Web2 social networks. An example of a decentralised social media dApp built on Ethereum is \"**[Minds](https://www.minds.com/)**\". Minds allows users to create, share and discover content while earning cryptocurrency tokens (MINDS tokens) for their contribution. Users have more control over their data and content, and the platform operates with a focus on transparency and user-driven governance.\n\n- **IPFS (InterPlanetaryFileSystem)**\n\nIn the traditional Web2 model, content such as images, videos and documents is stored on centralised servers. When you access a web page or other online content, your browser sends requests to these centralised servers to retrieve the data. This centralised storage system is susceptible to problems such as data loss, censorship and inefficiency. [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) is a Web3 technology that provides a decentralised and peer-to-peer approach to content storage and retrieval.\n\nAn example of IPFS in action is the decentralised web application \"Dweb.page\". It uses IPFS to load web pages, images and other assets. Users can access content even when the original websites are down, and content is stored and served from multiple IPFS nodes.\n\n- **Flow**\n\n**[Flow](https://flow.com/)** is a Web3 blockchain platform designed for building DApps and digital assets, such as NFTs.\n\nA prominent example of Flow's impact is the NBA Top Shot platform. It uses Flow's blockchain to create and trade officially licensed NBA collectible highlights (NFTs). Users can own and trade these digital collectibles like physical trading cards, and their ownership is securely recorded on the blockchain.\n\nAlso: **[filecoin](https://filecoin.io/)**, **[solana](https://solana.com/ru)**, **[cardano](https://cardano.org/)**, **[tezos](https://tezos.com/)**, **[polygon](https://polygon.technology/)**, **[avalanche](https://www.avax.network/)**, **[chainlink](https://chain.link/)**, **[kusama](https://kusama.network/)**, **[cosmos](https://cosmos.network/)**, **[algorand](https://algorand.com/)**, and more… \n\n---\n\n# Module conclusion\n\nAssetHub is an integral component of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.
