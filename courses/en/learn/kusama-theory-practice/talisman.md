# Introduction

## **Recap of first module**

Congratulations! You have succesfully completed first module of the Polkadot course, through which we went over a journey to understand the architecture and core functionalities of the Polkadot and Kusama networks. We explored how these multi-chain networks operate, the differences between Polkadot and Kusama, the main decision-making mechanism - NPoS consensus algorithm, the central rule of Polkadot - shared security, and the importance of governance, staking, and bonding using DOT and KSM tokens. We examined the ecosystem structure by envisioning a futuristic city interconnected and fulfilling all its functions, leading to a self-regulatory and self-sustaining environment for Web3 development.

## **Introduction to crypto-wallets**

Throughout this module we will delve into a few convenient solutions for managing your assets within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, starting with a lesson about the **Talisman** - a browser extension wallet specially designed to meet the needs of web3.

Cryptocurrency wallets play a vital role in the world of digital assets, acting as gateways to the decentralized world. One standout solution within the Polkadot ecosystem is Talisman wallet. However, it's not your typical wallet. Talisman offers full compatibility with the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, granting users access to a unified ecosystem with decentralized applications, DeFi platforms, and innovative projects, all thriving within the Polkadot network.

# Cross-chain transport

## Gateway between networks

Talisman is purposefully built for a multi-chain future, which setting it apart from most crypto-wallets. Unlike conventional wallets that mostly serve a single blockchain network, Talisman is a versatile solution designed to interact with a wide array of blockchains, making it a perfect companion for the future of web3.

As an essential part of the Polkadot ecosystem, Talisman makes it possible to manage over 150+ Substrate and EVM accounts through its support for [cross-chain interoperability.](https://polkadot.network/features/cross-chain-communication/)

Users can import their private keys from various blockchain wallets, including wallets from networks like Ethereum that are built on another framework. By importing their private keys, Talisman gains access to and can interact with the tokens associated with those keys on the respective networks. This integration allows users to view and manage all their assets from different networks in one unified interface. Whether it's swapping tokens, checking balances, or interacting with decentralized applications, Talisman simplifies the process by eliminating the need to switch between multiple wallets.

## **Bridges for external connectivity**

Talisman’s network extends beyond the confines of the Polkadot network to include external blockchains. When users want to transfer tokens from one network to another, Talisman utilizes these bridges to facilitate the movement of tokens across the interconnected networks.

Once users import their private keys and establish bridge connections, they can initiate token transfer transactions directly within Talisman. For instance, a user can transfer ETH tokens from their Ethereum wallet to their Polkadot wallet using Talisman's interface. Talisman executes the transfer through the established bridge, moving the tokens from one network to another.

# **What else can you do with your Talisman wallet?**

Cross - chain swaps isn’t the only feature making Talisman more than just a wallet. In addition to buying, storing, and managing crypto assets, it offers a few more features, enhancing user experience within the Polkadot ecosystem:

- **Staking in Talisman**

A user-friendly Talisman interface allows you to lock your tokens to support the network's security and consensus mechanism. This process is streamlined, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced users alike.

You can easily select the amount of tokens you wish (starting from 1 token) to stake and choose your preferred validator to delegate your tokens. The wallet provides clear and concise information about the staking process, including estimated rewards and staking duration.

Tokens available to stake: [DOT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/), [KSM](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kusama/), [AZERO](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aleph-zero/).

- **Crowdloans**

This is the part where users decide which projects will secure a parachain slot on the **Polkadot** or **Kusama** network by collecting contributions from individuals in exchange for rewards or incentives. Most of projects that runs for crowdloan offer their own tokens in exchange, **non-fungible tokens (NFT)** or an early access to their platform or services.

- **Import your existing accounts**

To start using Talisman wallet, you can create a new account in Polkadot or Ethereum networks, or you can import existing ones via recovery phrase. You can also import your Polkadot.js account via JSON file, or even connect your **Ledger** wallet.

<robo-academy-note type="note">
A Ledger wallet is a physical device that keeps your cryptocurrency safe. It stores your private keys offline, making it highly secure and less prone to hacking. We will talk about it in our next lesson.

# How to Set Up Your Talisman Wallet

The Talisman wallet web extension is available on Chromium-based browsers (such as Brave, Chrome, and Edge) and Firefox. You can find it on the [Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/talisman-polkadot-wallet/fijngjgcjhjmmpcmkeiomlglpeiijkld). If you haven't already, we recommend watching the video lesson for direct instructions on installation.
