# Introduction

We know for sure that tokens can represent ownership, utility, or access rights within a specific blockchain project or platform. In Polkadot, tokens can be both fungible and non-fungible assets, and can be used in a wide range of applications, from dApps to fundraising and community engagement. Through its AssetHub, you can create your own ERC20-like tokens (with limited functionality compared to standard ERC20 tokens) that are compatible with the Substrate-based blockchains and parachains inside the Polkadot ecosystem, and even non-fungible tokens (NFT’s) with NFT 2.0 functionalities.

Once the tokens are created, it’s time to share them with the community. In the video lesson you were taught to spread your testnet tokens for local needs, but you still have an option how big commercial projects sharing their tokens with the community, and the way an average user can earn money on it. So, the questions we’re asking are:

- What is a token distribution?
- What are the main ways to distribute tokens into the community?
- How do users make money on token distribution?

You will find those answers below!

# Token distribution in a nutshell

## What is a token distribution

At the heart of any stable-working blockchain are its users. They keep the network running and safe, increase the popularity of the network and price of tokens, and make important decisions that affect the networks future. That is why the success of a network is largely determined by how and to whom its native tokens are distributed.

Since the dawn of the cryptocurrency era, the primary method of allocating tokens to users was the process of **mining**. For instance, the Bitcoin blockchain, with its fixed supply capitalization of 21 million coins, initially rewarded miners with BTC for their efforts in validating and securing transactions through the Proof-of-Work algorithm. Over time, this reward has steadily diminished to regulate the coin issuance rate, rendering traditional mining less profitable. Subsequently, alternative consensus algorithms, such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS), have emerged, incentivizing users to defend the network by rewarding them with the native token. However, the crypto landscape has witnessed the emergence of a multitude of tokens, in addition to traditional coins.

Let’s refresh our memory about the main difference between coins and tokens: 

- Coins operate on their own blockchain;
- Tokens operate on the basis of another blockchain.

Tokens are not distributed through mining, as coins are; they have their unique distribution mechanisms. We will describe them below.

## ICO

The **Initial Coin Offering (ICO)** is considered to be one of the earliest mass methods for distributing cryptocyrrency. It is a new form of financing in which blockchain-related businesses raise public capital in exchange for new digital tokens. It can be compared to an Initial Public Offering (IPO), where companies sell their shares on a stock exchange to raise funds for business expansion and development. However, unlike them, ICOs are less strictly regulated and are usually used by young startups. During an ICO, a project or platform offers a portion of newly issued cryptocurrency tokens to investors in exchange for established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, or fiat currencies.

Let’s journey back to the very first ICO, performed by the **MasterCoin** in 2013 after its creator, J.R. Willett [popped up on the bitcointalk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=265488.0) explaining a supplementary protocol, improving Bitcoin blockchain with some additional features. He asked the community to contribute Bitcoin in exchange for MasterCoins, promising exclusive features for its holders. This ended up raising nearly $600.000!

 MasterCoin was not only the first to perform ICO, but also the first utility token.

Polkadot Network was also the one that chose the ICO path. The initial supply of DOT tokens was 1 billion and it went through four rounds of funding — one private and three public. The first ICO took place in 2017 and raised $80 million. The last one was held in 2020 and generated $42,76 million.

As a result of these, investors received 58,4% of the initial token supply, the founders held 30%, and the rest, 11,6%, was allocated through rewards and airdrops.

# AirDrops: Tokens from the Sky

Imagine waking up to discover money magically appearing in your wallet. While it may sound too good to be true, that’s a thing in crypto. Eventually, new crypto-projects spread their tokens in the community for free! That’s the allure of an **Airdrop** - a quite common, simple and widespread method of token distribution that has been around for nearly a decade. Airdrops are like gifts to loyal community members, designed to spark interest and reward their loalty. 

Most of airdrops are divided into two types: **retroactive** and **bounty**. 

## **Retroactive airdrop**

If you’ve heard of someone unexpectedly receiving tokens for their past actions or interactions in some project, even though it wasn’t publicly announced - be sure that's a **retroactive airdrop, or retro-drop**. This kind of AD can be described as a surprise gift from the past, recognizing your contributions to this project.

In retro-drop tokens are distributed to users based on their historical interactions or contributions to a particular ecosystem. In other words, a retro-drop rewards investors, supporters, users, and adopters who went with the project from the inception.

Participating in a retroactive airdrop is a great way to earn high returns with minimal investments. Take Uniswap's retro-drop, for instance. They sent 300 USDC to users with previous transactions and later distributed 400 UNIs each to ~12,000 addresses that ever interacted with their smart contracts. You can learn more about this event **[here](https://airdrops.io/uniswap/)**.

## **Bounty airdrop**

Bounty airdrops require participants to receive tokens in exchange for completing certain tasks or actions to support the goals of a project. These tasks typically promote and support project goals, such as raising awareness, engaging the community, or incentivising certain behaviours. They ask to:

- share post on social media;
- join Telegram groups;
- refer friends to the project.

Coin rewards serve to incentivize users to participate actively in project-related activities and contribute to project growth. One notable example is **Ontology**, which, in 2018, offered free ONT tokens to anyone who signed up for its newsletter to generate interest before the official token launch. Participants received 1000 ONT tokens, which were worth $2,800 when the token officially launched two months later.

# Crowdloans: Token Distribution through Community Engagement

Another way of distributing tokens of new projects into the community is crowdloans. You’re already familiar with this term since it is a major part of the Polkadot ecosystem and has been enlightened a few times during our course. Crowdloans were first introduced by Polkadot itself to help new projects raise funds for securing a parachain slot on Polkadot or Kusama. 

Here's how it works: 

When a project applies for a parachain slot, an auction takes place, requiring DOT or KSM tokens to bid for a slot. These tokens are collected from the Polkadot community, and, in return, contributors receive a predetermined amount of the project's tokens.

Imagine you hold 1 KSM token and are looking for investment opportunities. You browse through the projects participating in the Kusama crowdloan and choose one. This project offers 10 of its tokens in exchange for 1 KSM token. You lock your KSM tokens for this project, and if it wins the auction, you receive those 10 tokens. If not, your KSM tokens are returned. Additionally, you regain your KSM tokens when the parachain slot duration for this project expires.

The winner of the first auction was Karura, a decentralized finance platform that raised over 500.000 KSM tokens (worth over $100 million at the time) from more than 14.000 contributors. For each KSM token they gave away minimum 12 KAR and overall distributed almost 7 million KAR.
